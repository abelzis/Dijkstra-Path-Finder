Create a program that would find shortest path given start location and end location.
1) Find a way to add obstacles using mouse (like in paint)
	a) Divide the window into grid 100x100
		aa) Use initial WM_CREATE message to initialize grid
		bb) Use WM_SIZING message to correct grid if user resizes the window
	b) If mouse while drawing is on tile, -> tile.is_obstacle = true
2) Implement algorithm
	a) Obstacle has bool value obs = true
	b) if next_tile.is_obstacle != true, then we can move onto tile
3) UI
	a) User can put Start point anywhere on the board.
	b) User can put End point anywhere on the board.
	c) User can draw Obstacles anywhere on the board.
	d) User can press the Start button to start visualization.
	e) User can drag Speed-bar to increase/decrease the speed of visualization.
